    <p><em>Soil Electrical Conductivity (EC)</em></p>

<p>
Electrical conductivity (EC) is the ability of an aqueous solution to carry an electric current. 
It is the most common measure of soil salinity. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) correlates with soil properties including texture, 
cation exchange capacity, drainage, organic matter level, salinity, and subsoil characteristics. 
Plants are detrimentally affected by excess salts in some soils and by high levels of exchangeable Sodium in others.
The electrical conductivity of soils varies depending on the amount of moisture held by soil particles.
Sands have a low conductivity, silts have a medium conductivity, and clays have a high conductivity. Na+.
Electrical Conductivity (EC) is commonly expressed in units of decisiemens/m.
