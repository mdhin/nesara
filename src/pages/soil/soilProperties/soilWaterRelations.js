    <li>Soil texture and organic matter content determine its water holding capacity (WHC), rate of water intake, percolation, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), etc.</li>
    <li>WHC and CEC increase with increase in clay content and depth.</li>
    <li>Water intake and percolation increase with increase in the proportion of sand.</li>
