    <p><em>Soil Fertility and Productivity</em></p>
    <p>
        Soil fertility and productivity is the ability of soil to sustain agricultural plant growth. 
    It is the ability to supply essential plant nutrients and water in adequate amounts 
    and proportions for plant growth and reproduction. Conventionally, soil fertility is referred to as
    soil health. So, a Soil Health Card (SHC) contains information on the nutrient contents of the
    soil, pH, EC and Organic Carbon, and does not reflect the actual health of the soil.
