    <p>4. Use cover crops</p>
<p>
    Cover crops keep the soil covered during
    periods of time when crops have not formed
    a good canopy, reducing the risk of erosion.
The biomass produced by cover crops is
usually returned to the soil, enhancing
organic matter levels.
Cover crops with taproots can create
macropores and alleviate compaction.
Species of cover crops that host mycorrhizal
fungi can sustain and increase the population
of these beneficial fungi.
Legume cover crops can add Nitrogen to the
soil through Nitrogen fixation.
Cover crops can retain nitrate and other
nutrients that are susceptible to leaching
losses.
