    <p>8. Add beneficial organisms</p>
<p>Add bio-control agents like Trichoderma viride, Trichoderma harzianum,
Pseudomonas fluorescens, Bacillus subtilis, Fusarium proliferatum (against fungi), 
Bacillus firmus, Paecilomyces lilacinus 
(against nematodes), for control of soilborne pathogens. 
Add bio-fertilizers like Nitrogen fixing bacteria, Phosphorus solubilizing bacteria,
Potassium mobilizing bacteria, Ferrous mobilizing bacteria, Zinc mobilizing bacteria, 
Sulphur mobilizing bacteria, Manganese 
solubilizing microbe, Vesicular Arbuscular Mycorrhizae (VAM), etc. 
Jeevamrutha may also be added periodically to maintain the beneficial micro-organisms
in the soil. Jeevamrutha, provides a congenial environment to soil microorganisms that
play an important role in making available essential nutrients for plant growth viz.,
Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium to the plants. It encourages microbial activity in the soil
and improves soil health considerably.
