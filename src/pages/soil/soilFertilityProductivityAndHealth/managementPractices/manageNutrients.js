    <p>7. Manage Nutrients</p>
<p>Minimise nutrient excess by carefully
planning the timing, application method,
and quantity of manure, compost, and other
fertilizers. Over-fertilizing can increase pest problems.
Increasing soluble Nitrogen levels in plants
can decrease their resistance to pests,
resulting in higher pest density and crop
damage. Maintain soil pH appropriate for the crop
to improve nutrient availability and reduce
toxicity. Maintain adequate Calcium levels to
help earthworms thrive and improve soil
aggregation. Use diverse nutrient sources, which help in
maintaining soil fertility. Manure and compost add organic matter as
well as an array of nutrients. But using just
compost or manure to meet the Nitrogen
needs of the crop every year can result in
excessive Phosphorus levels in the soil. Combine modest manure or compost
additions to meet Phosphorus needs with
additional Nitrogen inputs from legume cover
or forage crops in a crop rotation to balance
both Nitrogen and Phosphorus inputs.
