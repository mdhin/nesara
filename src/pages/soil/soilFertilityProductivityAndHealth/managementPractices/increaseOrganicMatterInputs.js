    <p>3. Increase organic matter inputs</p>
<p>
The inputs of organic matter must meet or exceed the losses of organic matter due to decomposition.
Healthy crops can be a valuable source of organic matter, and crop residues should be returned to the soil to the extent possible.
Incorporation of cover crops or perennial crops and judicious additions of green manure, green leaf manure and compost
can also be used to increase or maintain soil organic matter.
