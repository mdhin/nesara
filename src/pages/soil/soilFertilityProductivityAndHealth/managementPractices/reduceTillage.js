    <p>1. Reduce Tillage</p>
        <p>Excessive tillage increases oxygen in the
        soil, stimulates microbial activity, and results
        in the decomposition of organic matter. Tillage also disrupts soil aggregates,
        exposing particles of organic matter that
        were otherwise protected from microbial
        consumption. If additions of organic matter are not
        sufficient to counteract the losses from
        decomposition, organic matter levels will
        decline over time, reducing soil health. Inversion tillage also reduces the soil
        coverage provided by crop residues, leaving
        soil more exposed to erosion. Tillage can also disrupt the hyphal network
        of Mycorrhizal fungi, which can lead to their
        decline over time.
