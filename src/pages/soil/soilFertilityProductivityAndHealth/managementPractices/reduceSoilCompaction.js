    <p>2. Reduce Soil Compaction</p>
<p>Soil compaction occurs when soil is exposed to excessive human and equipment traffic 
    while the soil is wet and plastic. Compaction results in reduction of pore 
    space and increased bulk density, leading to poor water infiltration and drainage and
    increased runoff. Soil compaction increases soil hardness,
    making it more difficult for plant roots to grow through the soil. 
    Compaction and removal of surface residue may contribute to reduction in soil moisture 
    and living space for soil-dwelling organisms.
