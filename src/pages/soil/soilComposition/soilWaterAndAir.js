    <p><em>3. Soil Water and Air</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Soil water that is also called Soil Solution, is the dilute solution containing small amounts of every soluble compound present in the soils.</li>
    <li>Soil water promotes physical and biological activities of soil, acts as solvent and carrier of nutrients and maintains turgidity of plants.</li>
    <li>Soil water transports nutrients to the root, to the soil surface or subsoil depending on the direction of water flow.</li>
    <li>Soil air is essential for most of the biological reactions in the soil.</li>
    <li>Soil air has about ten times more carbon dioxide than atmospheric air, due to respiration by roots and soil microorganisms.</li>
    <li>Soil air is the pathway for intake of oxygen that is absorbed by soil microorganisms and plant roots and for escape of Carbon dioxide produced by the plants.</li>
    <li>This process called soil aeration is critical for plant growth when water content is high and water replaces soil air.</li>
