    <p><em>1. Soil Mineral Matter</em></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>Mineral matter is largely made up of Oxygen and Silicon.</li>
    <li>Most abundantly available plant nutrients are Iron, Potassium and Magnesium.</li>
    <li>The particulate size ranges from large pieces of gravel to coarse sand (2 - 0.2 mm) to fine clay (0.002 mm).</li>
    <li>The mineral matter determines the soil texture and its water holding capacity.</li>
    <li>Silt is a storehouse of nutrients, while clay along with organic matter is most active.</li>
